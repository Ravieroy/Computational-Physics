These are VPython codes which can be run locally, but it is much better to use [Glowscript](https://glowscript.org/) or [Trinket](https://trinket.io/) to run these type of programs. Just make a free account there and run VPython codes there. To run locally, vpython module is needed which can be installed using pip.
