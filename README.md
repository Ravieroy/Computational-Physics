# Computational Physics Codes
---
## This repository contains all my computational physics codes. Most of the stuffs are pretty basic and was written during my Master's degree. Few stuffs are more advanced and those codes might help somebody who need it. 

## Following is the name and description of what the codes do. Will keep updating the codes and adding more.
